1. Implement 3 stacks using single array


2. Design stack supporting min operation in O(1) time
Ans Challenge we can keep min element in stack but when min is popped out we have to find next min in stack
	a) Along with every element in stack put a min element new NodeWithMin(value, newMin)	
		this waste lot of space
	b) Maintain another stack with min elements, previously you maintain each element with min element now 
	keep only some minimal elements. You will add in min stack if and only if the new element is smaller than min element.
	
3. Stack of plates
